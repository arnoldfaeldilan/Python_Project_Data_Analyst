### Visualize Data

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(job_titles), 1, figsize=(8, 8))

for i, job_title in enumerate(job_titles):
    df_plot = df_skills_perc[df_skills_perc['job_title_short'] == job_title].head(5)
    sns.barplot(df_plot,x='percentage', y='job_skills', ax=ax[i], hue='percentage', palette='dark:b_r')

plt.show()
```

### Insights


1. Python and SQL are must-have skills across all data roles.

2. Excel and Tableau are still very relevant for Data Analysts but less so for Engineers and Scientists.

3. Cloud and Big Data tools (AWS, Azure, Spark) are essential for Data Engineers.

4. R and SAS are more niche or legacy tools â€” useful but not primary.

5. Role Focus Differentiation:
    - Analysts: Reporting, visualization, business interaction.
    - Engineers: Infrastructure, cloud, data pipelines.
    - Scientists: Advanced analytics, modeling, machine learning.

6. SQL is highly demanded for Data Engineers (68%) and equally for Analysts and Scientists (51%), while Python peaks for Data Scientists (72%), followed by Engineers (65%) and Analysts (27%).

## 2. How are in-demand skills are trending for Data Analysts?

### Visualize Data

```python
sns.lineplot(df_plot, dashes=False, palette='tab10', legend=False)
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')
sns.despine()

for i in range(5):
    plt.text(3, df_plot.iloc[4, i], df_plot.columns[i])

plt.tight_layout()

```
